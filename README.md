# JWLI responsive webpage!

https://jwli-fjh.netlify.app/

### What I did to build this app:

I used HTML and CSS to code this project

I mainly used floated elements to structure the page.
### Lessons Learned :
- I noticed that removing content from the page helped manage the flow of the page at smaller screen size denominations in the developer tools, which helped me visualize my code better
- Setting background colors to certain elements helps organize my code more to dictate which element is getting which CSS styles
